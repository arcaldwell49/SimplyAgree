## Important Notes for Reviewers

### Documentation Folder

⚠️ **The `docs/` folder should be IGNORED when reviewing changes.**

The `docs/` folder is auto-generated by pkgdown and deployed to GitHub Pages. It is rebuilt automatically via GitHub Actions on every push to the main/master branch. Manual changes to this folder are not needed and will be overwritten.

### Auto-Generated Files

The following files/folders are auto-generated and typically should not be manually edited:
- `docs/` - pkgdown website
- `man/` - Documentation (generated from roxygen2 comments in R code)
- `NAMESPACE` - Package namespace (generated by roxygen2)

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

1. Install R (>= 3.6)
2. Install required development packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "pkgdown", "rcmdcheck"))
   ```



### Code Style

Follow standard R package development practices:
- Use roxygen2 for documentation
- Follow the tidyverse style guide when possible
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update NEWS.md for user-facing changes
