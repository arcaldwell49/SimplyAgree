# Background

`SimplyAgree` is an R package, and [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) module, created to make agreement and reliability analyses easier for the average researcher. The two primary functions are `agreement_limit` and `tolerance_limit` for assessing "agreement" between two methods. Reliability can be assessed via the `reli_stats`, or `reli_aov`, function. In addition, `blandPowerCurve` could be utilized for power analysis purposes for studies of agreement.

## Installing SimplyAgree

You can install the most up-to-date version of `SimplyAgree` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/arcaldwell49/SimplyAgree) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("arcaldwell49/SimplyAgree")
```
