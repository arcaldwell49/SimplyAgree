`SimplyAgree` is an R package, and [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) module, created to make agreement and reliability analyses easier for the average researcher. The functions within this package include simple tests of agreement (`agree_test`), agreement analysis for nested (`agree_nest`) and replicate data (`agree_reps`), and provide robust analyses of reliability (`reli_stats`). In addition, this package contains a set of functions to help when planning studies looking to assess measurement agreement (`blandPowerCurve`).

## Installing SimplyAgree

You can install the most up-to-date version of `SimplyAgree` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/arcaldwell49/SimplyAgree) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("arcaldwell49/SimplyAgree")
```
