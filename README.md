This is a R package for calculating absolute agreement and estimating
the required sample size for a study attempting to estimate absolute
agreement.

The functions in this package are largely based on the following works:

Lin L (1989). A concordance correlation coefficient to evaluate
reproducibility. *Biometrics* 45: 255 - 268.

quantitative measurements: Exact test procedure and sample size
calculation. *Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research*, 1-8.
