Description: This package calculate absolute agreement between two continuous variables (agree_test), those with replicates (agree_reps), and with nested data (agree_reps and loa_mixed). Power calculations for Bland-Altman agreement limits can be calculated with the blandPowerCurve function. In addition, test-restest reliability can also be estimated (reli_stats).
