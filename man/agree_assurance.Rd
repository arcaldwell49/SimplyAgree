\title{Sample Size for Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (Assurance Probability)}
\usage{
agree_assurance(
  conf.level = 0.95,
  assurance = 0.9,
  omega = NULL,
  pstar = 0.95,
  sigma = 1,
  n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the range of agreement (1 - alpha)}

\item{assurance}{target assurance probability (1 - gamma)}

\item{omega}{upper bound of assurance half-width}

\item{pstar}{central proportion covered (P*)}

\item{sigma}{population standard deviation of paired differences}

\item{n}{sample size (if solving for another parameter)}
}
\value{
An object of class "power.htest" with the computed sample size and
other parameters.
}
\description{
Calculate the sample size needed for a confidence interval of the Bland-Altman
range of agreement using the assurance probability criterion. Based on the exact
method of Jan and Shieh (2018).
}
\details{
This function implements the exact method for determining sample size based on
assurance probability for Bland-Altman limits of agreement, as described in
Jan and Shieh (2018). The assurance probability is the probability that the
confidence interval half-width will be no more than omega.

The method uses equal-tailed tolerance intervals based on the noncentral
t-distribution to construct exact confidence intervals for the range of
agreement.
