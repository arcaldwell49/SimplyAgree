\title{Sample Size for Limits of Agreement Using Expected Half-Width}
\usage{
agree_expected_half(
  conf.level = 0.95,
  delta = NULL,
  pstar = 0.95,
  sigma = 1,
  n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the range of agreement (1 - alpha).
The confidence level of the confidence interval of the range of agreement
(tolerance interval). Default is 0.95.}

\item{delta}{target upper bound of expected half-width (delta). The sample size
guarantees that the expected half-width of the confidence interval will be
no more than this value. Can be specified in standard deviation units.}

\item{pstar}{central proportion of the data distribution covered (P*). It is
the proportion of observations that fall between the limits. For example, a
value of 0.95 indicates that 95\% of the variable's values fall between the
limits. Must be between 0 and 1. Common values are 0.90 or 0.95.}

\item{sigma}{population standard deviation of the paired differences. If the
true value is unknown, delta can be specified in standard deviation units
by setting sigma = 1.}

\item{n}{sample size (optional). If provided, the function will solve for a
different parameter rather than sample size.}

\details{
Calculate the sample size necessary for a confidence interval of the Bland-Altman
range of agreement when the underlying data distribution is normal. This function
uses the expected half-width criterion to determine the optimum sample size,
based on the exact confidence interval method of Jan and Shieh (2018), which has
been shown to be superior to approximate methods.
\subsection{Overview}{

This function implements the exact method for determining sample size based on
expected half-width for Bland-Altman limits of agreement, as described in
Jan and Shieh (2018). The expected half-width criterion determines an N that
guarantees that the expected half-width of the confidence interval is less than
a boundary value delta.
}

\subsection{Technical Details}{

Suppose a study involves paired differences (X - Y) whose distribution is
approximately N(mu, sigma^2). The range of agreement is defined as a confidence
interval of the central portion of these differences, specifically the area
between the 100(1-p)th and 100p-th percentiles, where p* = 2p - 1.

The exact two-sided, 100(1 - alpha)\% confidence interval for the range of
agreement is defined as:

Pr(theta_(1-p) < theta_hat_(1-p) and theta_hat_p < theta_p) = 1 - alpha

The equal-tailed tolerance interval recommended by Jan and Shieh (2018) is:

(X_bar - d, X_bar + d)

where d = g * S, g is the Odeh-Owen tolerance factor (tabulated as g'' in
Odeh and Owen (1980) and Hahn and Meeker (1991)), and S is the sample
standard deviation.
}

\subsection{Sample Size Determination}{

The sample size N is selected to satisfy: E(H) <= delta

where H is the half-width of the confidence interval. This leads to the
expression:

g(P*, 1-alpha, N-1) / c <= delta / sigma

where c is a bias correction factor:

c = (Gamma((N-1)/2) * sqrt((N-1)/2)) / Gamma(N/2)

The expected half-width is E(H) = (g/c) * sigma. This accounts for the fact
that the sample standard deviation S is a biased estimator of sigma, requiring
correction when computing expected values.

The method uses equal-tailed tolerance intervals based on the noncentral
t-distribution to construct exact confidence intervals for the range of
agreement. The tolerance factor g is calculated such that the interval
maintains the specified confidence level under normality.
}

\subsection{Comparison with Assurance Probability Method}{

This function uses the expected half-width criterion, which ensures that
E(H) <= delta. An alternative approach is the assurance probability criterion
(see \code{\link[=agree_assurance]{agree_assurance()}}), which ensures that Pr(H <= omega) >= 1 - gamma.

The expected half-width criterion:
\itemize{
\item Controls the average half-width across repeated sampling
\item Generally requires smaller sample sizes than assurance probability
\item Is appropriate when the average performance is of primary interest
}

The assurance probability criterion:
\itemize{
\item Provides a probability guarantee about the half-width
\item Generally requires larger sample sizes
\item Is appropriate when a stronger guarantee is needed for planning purposes
}
}

\subsection{Interpreting Results}{

Each subject produces two measurements (one for each method being compared).
The sample size n returned is the number of subject pairs needed. The actual
expected half-width may differ slightly from the target due to the discrete
nature of sample size.

For dropout considerations, inflate the sample size using: N' = N / (1 - dropout_rate),
always rounding up.
