\title{Sample Size for Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (Expected Half-Width)}
\usage{
agree_expected_half(
  conf.level = 0.95,
  delta = NULL,
  pstar = 0.95,
  sigma = 1,
  n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the range of agreement (1 - alpha)}

\item{delta}{upper bound of expected half-width}

\item{pstar}{central proportion covered (P*)}

\item{sigma}{population standard deviation of paired differences}

\item{n}{sample size (if solving for another parameter)}
}
\value{
An object of class "power.htest" with the computed sample size and
other parameters.
}
\description{
Calculate the sample size needed for a confidence interval of the Bland-Altman
limits of agreement using the expected half-width criterion. Based on the exact
method of Jan and Shieh (2018).
}
\details{
This function implements the exact method for determining sample size based on
expected half-width for Bland-Altman limits of agreement, as described in
Jan and Shieh (2018). The method ensures that the expected half-width of the
confidence interval is no more than delta.

The method uses equal-tailed tolerance intervals based on the noncentral
t-distribution to construct exact confidence intervals for the range of
agreement. The expected half-width is E(H) = (g/c)*sigma, where g is the
tolerance interval factor and c is a bias correction factor.
