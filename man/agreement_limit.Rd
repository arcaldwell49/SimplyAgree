\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of column with first measurement}

\item{y}{Name of other column with the other measurement to compare to the first.}

\item{id}{Column with subject identifier. Default is "id" if no entry is provided.}

\item{data}{Data frame with all data.}

\item{data_type}{The type of data structure. Options include "simple" (all independent data points), "nest" (nested data) and "reps" (replicated data points).}

\item{loa_calc}{The method by which the limits of agreement confidence intervals are calculated. Options are "mover" (Methods of Recovering Variances method) or "blandlatman" (Bland-Altman method).}

\item{agree.level}{the agreement level required. Default is 95\%. The proportion of data that should lie between the thresholds, for 95\% limits of agreement this should be 0.95.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha-level for confidence levels.}

\item{prop_bias}{Logical indicator (TRUE/FALSE) of whether proportional bias should be considered for the limits of agreement calculations.}

\item{log_tf}{Calculate limits of agreement using log-transformed data.}
}
\value{
Returns single loa class object with the results of the agreement analysis.
\itemize{
\item \code{loa}: A data frame containing the Limits of Agreement.
\item \code{call}:The matched call.

A function for calculating for Bland-Altman limits of agreement based on the difference between two measurements (difference = x-y).
Please note that the package developer recommends reporting/using tolerance limits (see \code{"tolerance_limit"} function).
}
\details{
The limits of agreement (LoA) are calculated in this function are based on the method originally detailed by Bland & Atlman (1986 & 1999).
The \code{loa_calc} allow users to specify the calculative method for the LoA which can be based on Bland-Altman (1999) (\code{loa_calc = "blandaltman"}),
or by the more accurate MOVER method of Zou (2013) and Donner & Zou (2012) (\code{loa_calc = "mover"}).

\examples{
data('reps')

# Simple
agreement_limit(x = "x", y ="y", data = reps)

# Replicates
agreement_limit(x = "x", y ="y", data = reps, id = "id", data_type = "rep")

# Nested
agreement_limit(x = "x", y ="y", data = reps, id = "id", data_type = "nest")
