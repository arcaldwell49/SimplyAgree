agreement_limit(
  x,
  y,
  id = NULL,
  data,
  data_type = c("simple", "nest", "reps"),

\arguments{
\item{x}{Name of column with first measurement}

\item{y}{Name of other column with the other measurement to compare to the first.}

\item{id}{Column with subject identifier. Default is "id" if no entry is provided.}

\item{data}{Data frame with all data.}

\item{data_type}{The type of data structure. Options include "simple" (all independent data points), "nest" (nested data) and "reps" (replicated data points).}

\item{loa_calc}{The method by which the limits of agreement confidence intervals are calculated. Options are "mover" (Methods of Recovering Variances method) or "blandlatman" (Bland-Altman method).}

\item{agree.level}{the agreement level required. Default is 95\%. The proportion of data that should lie between the thresholds, for 95\% limits of agreement this should be 0.95.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha-level for confidence levels.}

\item{prop_bias}{Logical indicator (TRUE/FALSE) of whether proportional bias should be considered for the limits of agreement calculations.}

\item{log_tf}{Calculate limits of agreement using log-transformed data.}
}
\value{
Returns single loa class object with the results of the agreement analysis.
\itemize{
\item \code{loa}: A data frame containing the Limits of Agreement.
\item \code{call}:The matched call.

A function for calculating for limits of agreement. Please note that the package developer recommends reporting/using tolerance limits (see \code{"tolerance_limit"} function).
