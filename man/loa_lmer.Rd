\usage{
loa_lmer(
  diff,
  avg,
  condition = NULL,
  id,
  data,
  type = "perc",
  conf.level = 0.95,
  agree.level = 0.95,
  replicates = 999,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{diff}{Column name of the data frame that includes the difference between the 2 measurements of interest.}

\item{avg}{Column name of the data frame that includes the difference between the 2 measurements of interest.}

\item{condition}{Column name indicating different conditions subjects were tested under. This can be left missing if there are no differing conditions to be tested.}

\item{id}{Column name indicating the subject/participant identifier}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables within the model.}

\item{type}{A character string representing the type of bootstrap confidence intervals. Only "norm", "basic", and "perc" currently supported. Bias-corrected and accelerated, bca, is the default. See ?boot::boot.ci for more details.}

\item{conf.level}{the confidence level required. Default is 95\%.}

\item{agree.level}{the agreement level required. Default is 95\%.}

\item{replicates}{the number of bootstrap replicates. Passed on to the boot function. Default is 999.}

\item{prop_bias}{Logical indicator (TRUE/FALSE) of whether proportional bias should be considered for the limits of agreement calculations.}
}
\value{
Returns single list with the results of the agreement analysis.

\describe{
  \item{\code{"var_comp"}}{Table of variance components}
  \item{\code{"loa"}}{A data frame of the limits of agreement including the average difference between the two sets of measurements, the standard deviation of the difference between the two sets of measurements and the lower and upper confidence limits of the difference between the two sets of measurements.}
  \item{\code{"call"}}{The matched call.}
}
}
\description{
This function allows for the calculation of bootstrapped limits of agreement when there are multiple observations per subject.
