# Summary

Accurate and reliable measurements are critical to quantitative research efforts. Based on citation counts, researchers highly value methods to quantify the accuracy and reliability of the measurement tools [@bland1986, @weir2005]. This article introduces the `SimplyAgree` R package and jamovi module as user-friendly solutions to estimating agreement and reliability.

# Statment of Need

A number of new methods have been developed in the past two decades to improve the calculation of the limits of agreement.  However, to author's best knowledge, statistical software &mdash; particularly open source software &mdash; to implement these tools.

# Acknowledgements

I would like the thank Ashley Akerman for his kind feedback during the development of this package.
