# SimplyAgree: Flexible and Robust Agreement and Reliability Analyses

Reliability and agreement analyses often have limited software support.
Therefore, this package was created to make agreement and reliability
analyses easier for the average researcher. The functions within this
package include simple tests of agreement, agreement analysis for nested
and replicate data, and provide robust analyses of reliability. In
addition, this package contains a set of functions to help when planning
studies looking to assess measurement agreement.
