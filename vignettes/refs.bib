  author    = "Jan, Show-Li and Shieh, Gwowen",
  abstract  = "The Bland-Altman analysis has been widely used to assess the
               agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The
               range of agreement is thus represented by the designated central
               proportion of the distribution of the paired differences. This
               article aims to provide concrete guidance on the use of accurate
               confidence intervals of the range of agreement. Theoretical
               examination and numerical comparison are conducted to support
               the exact approach and to demonstrate the disadvantages of the
               currently suggested methods for confidence interval estimation
               of the range of agreement. For the purpose of design planning,
               the associated sample size calculations for precise interval
               estimation of the range of agreement are delineated under the
               expected width and assurance probability considerations. To
               enhance the utility of the recommended confidence interval and
               sample size procedures in practical applications, both SAS and R
               computer algorithms are also developed.",

  title     = "Methods and reagent-lot comparisons by regression analysis:
               Sample size considerations",
  author    = "Sadler, William A",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Parametric regression analysis is widely used in
               methods comparisons and more recently in checking the
               concordance of test results following receipt of new reagent
               lots. The greater frequency of reagent-lot evaluations increases
               pressure to detect bias with smallest possible sample sizes
               (i.e. smallest consumption of time and resources). This study
               revisits bias detection using the joint slope, intercept
               confidence region as an alternative to slope and intercept
               confidence intervals. METHODS: Four cases were considered
               representing constant errors, proportional errors (constant CV)
               and two more complicated error patterns typical of immunoassays.
               Maximum:minimum range ratios varied from 2:1 to 2000:1. After
               setting a maximum tolerable difference a series of slope,
               intercept combinations, each of which predicted the critical
               difference, were systematically evaluated in simulations which
               determined the minimum sample size required to detect the
               difference, firstly using slope, intercept confidence intervals
               and secondly using the joint slope, intercept confidence region.
               RESULTS: At small to moderate range ratios, bias detection by
               joint confidence region required greatly reduced sample sizes to
               the extent that it should encourage reagent-lot evaluations or,
               alternatively, transform those already routinely performed into
               considerably less costly exercises. CONCLUSIONS: While some
               software is available to calculate joint confidence regions in
               real-life analyses, shifting this testing method into the
               mainstream will require a greater number of software developers
               incorporating the necessary code into their regression programs.
               The computer program used to conduct this study is freely
               available and can be used to model any laboratory test.",
